A reusable card component using CSS padding, margin, display, and position.

Explanation:

1. Margin - I used margin in my .box class. This functions as a way to separate each card from each other and from the top and sides of page.
2. Padding - This was also used in my .box class and was necessary to put space between my image/text and the border.
3. Display - I used the inline-block display option in the .box class to make the cards line up in the same row but also take up the necessary space they need.
4. Position - Position was used to make flickr, youtube, and linkedin logos "stick" to the top left corner of each card. To do this I made the .box position relative and the image-logo position absolute. This made the image out of the order the HTML is written and go to the top corner no matter what.
